# Code-Quiz

## Description

Created a timed coding quiz using the HTML, CSS, and javaScipt concepts learned. 

Used HTML to create the structure of the webpage and CSS to style it to make it look nice and responsive to the user.  

Applied all the javaScript skills learned so far to create a quiz that functions with a timer and save scores into local storage. 

Used variables to store different elements of the quiz to use them in functions needed to make the quiz interactive.

Click events were used to allow the user to start the game, go to the next question, submit scores, reset scores, and return back to the start.

To save scores entered into the game, utitlized local storage and JSON to convert the objects into values that can be displayed. 

Used a for loop to run through and display scores entered into the score table. 

Learned how to design and style a webpage that can interact with user with the use of javaScipt.
